# Blog Platform with Tkinter and SQLite

This repository contains a simple blog platform implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and SQLite for database management. The application allows users to upload and view blog posts, demonstrating basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **Upload Blog Window:** Users can add new blog posts by providing a title and content. The application stores this information in an SQLite database.

- **Display Blogs Window:** Users can view all the uploaded blog posts. The content is displayed in a scrollable text area, allowing easy navigation through posts.

- **Exception Handling:** The code includes exception handling to gracefully manage potential errors, such as database connection issues or data retrieval problems.

- **Scalable and Readable:** The code is organized into classes and functions, making it modular and easy to understand. Inline comments are provided for clarity.
